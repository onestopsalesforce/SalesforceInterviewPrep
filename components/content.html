        <p>This blog has been created with the intention of serving as a Salesforce Concepts Refresher and not as detailed notes. It is primarily aimed at helping users with Interview Preparation.</p>
        
        <p>Please note the following important points:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>This blog reflects my understanding of the concepts, documented and consolidated under Turing Minds Consulting LLC.

            <li>This blog is still in its initial stages, and I plan to expand it by including helpful materials such as good YouTube videos that explain the concepts in detail.</li>
            <li>The intention behind this website is to act as a one-stop resource for Salesforce developers to refer to while learning. It is meant to help those learning Salesforce concepts quickly.</li>
