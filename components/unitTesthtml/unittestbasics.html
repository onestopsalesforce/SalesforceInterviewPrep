            <h2>Assert Related Methods</h2>
            <p>
                The below methods are used in Salesforce Apex unit tests to validate conditions, ensuring that expected outcomes are met by asserting equality, boolean values, instance types, and null checks, with options to specify custom messages and handle both positive and negative test cases
            </p>

            <h2>`Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` with Asynchronous Execution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Test.startTest()</strong>: Marks the start of a test context, resetting governor limits to allow more resource consumption during the test.</li>
                        <li><strong>Test.stopTest()</strong>: Marks the end of the test context, where asynchronous operations are executed immediately.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Governor Limits:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Governor limits are <strong>reset</strong> during `Test.startTest()` to allow more flexibility in resource-heavy operations.</li>
                        <li>After `Test.stopTest()`, the limits are restored to their original values.</li>
                        <li><strong class="green-box">Note:</strong> @testSetup methods do not count against the governor limits for test execution, but they must still adhere to the org-wide limits, such as the 10,000 records limit</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Execution:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Before `Test.startTest()`</strong>: Set up test data, such as inserting records or triggering asynchronous operations. Asynchronous operations like `@future` methods, batch jobs, and queueable jobs are <strong>queued</strong> but not executed yet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Between `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()`</strong>: Asynchronous operations are <strong>queued</strong> but <strong>not executed</strong> until `Test.stopTest()` is called.</li>
                        <li><strong>When `Test.stopTest()` is called</strong>: Any asynchronous operations (such as `@future` methods or batch jobs) that were queued during the test execution are <strong>executed immediately and synchronously</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>When Asynchronous Processes Kick In:</strong>
                    <p>Asynchronous operations like `@future` methods, batch jobs, and queueable methods are triggered during the test execution, but they do not run until <strong>Test.stopTest()</strong> is called. At the moment of `Test.stopTest()`, these asynchronous jobs are executed synchronously within the test context, allowing the test to assert their results immediately.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li><strong>Key Points:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Resetting Governor Limits</strong>: `Test.startTest()` resets the governor limits, providing more resources for the test.</li>
                        <li><strong>Immediate Execution Post `Test.stopTest()`</strong>: Asynchronous jobs like `@future` methods and batches are executed immediately after `Test.stopTest()`.</li>
                        <li><strong>Validating Results</strong>: After `Test.stopTest()`, you can assert results of asynchronous operations within the same test method.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            @isTest
                            private class AsyncTestClass {
                                @isTest static void testAsyncMethod() {
                                    // Set up test data
                                    Account acc = new Account(Name = 'Test Account');

                                    // Trigger an asynchronous operation (future method)
                                    MyAsyncClass.myFutureMethod(acc.Id);
                                    
                                    Test.stopTest();  // Immediately execute the asynchronous operation
                                    
                                    // Assert the outcome of the asynchronous operation
                                    Account updatedAcc = [SELECT Id, Status__c FROM Account WHERE Id = :acc.Id];
                                    System.assertEquals('Processed', updatedAcc.Status__c);

            <h2>@TestVisbile , Test.isRunningTest</h2>

            <h3>@TestVisible</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The @TestVisible annotation in Salesforce is required when you need to expose private or protected class variables, methods, or properties to test classes for unit testing purposes</li>
                <li>By default, private members are not accessible in test classes, but using @TestVisible allows test methods to verify and validate their behavior</li>
                <li>In many cases, private variables or methods are indirectly tested when the public methods that use them are tested</li>  
                <li>If a private variable or method's behavior needs to be validated in isolation, beyond the scope of public method testing. For instance, if the internal state affects multiple methods, and you want to ensure it behaves as expected under different scenarios.</li>  
                <li>@TestVisible is helpful but should only be used sparingly and thoughtfully, as exposing private details unnecessarily can reduce encapsulation and introduce maintainability risks</li>            
            </ul>    
            
            <h3>Test.isRunningTest</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Test.isRunningTest is a static method in Salesforce that returns a Boolean value indicating whether the current code is being executed within the context of a test method</li>
                <li>It is useful for conditionally executing code or logic that should only run during testing, allowing for more controlled and isolated test scenarios</li>
                <li>For example, you might use Test.isRunningTest to bypass certain logic or to set up specific test data when running unit tests, ensuring that your tests are reliable and focused on the intended functionality</li>
                <li>Use Sparingly: Overusing Test.isRunningTest can lead to tightly coupled test and production code, reducing flexibility and maintainability</li>
                <li>Mock Where Possible: Prefer using dependency injection or mock frameworks (e.g., HttpCalloutMock) instead of adding Test.isRunningTest directly in production logic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Test Suites in Salesforce</h2>
            <p>
              A Test Suite in Salesforce is a collection of test classes and test methods grouped together to be executed as a single unit. 
              Test Suites are particularly useful for organizing tests by functionality, feature, or project scope and make it easier to run targeted test sets.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Benefits of Using Test Suites</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Organized Testing:</strong> Group tests by feature, team, or sprint.</li>
              <li><strong>Focused Runs:</strong> Run only the relevant tests instead of the entire test class set.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduces time spent managing and running individual test classes.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>How to Create a Test Suite in Developer Console</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Open the <strong>Developer Console</strong>.</li>
              <li>Navigate to <strong>Test</strong> → <strong>New Suite</strong>.</li>
              <li>Select the test classes that need to be included in the Test Suite.</li>
              <li>Save the suite and run it as needed.</li>
            </ol>
