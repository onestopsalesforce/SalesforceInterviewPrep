        <h1>Unit Testing in Salesforce: Sharing Rules, Assignment Rules, and FLS</h1>

        <h2>Unit Testing Sharing Rules</h2>
        <p>Sharing Rules define access permissions for records based on criteria or ownership. To unit test sharing rules effectively, ensure that the rules work as expected by dynamically assigning record access.</p>

        <h3>Example Test for Sharing Rules</h3>
        <p>The following example demonstrates how to test sharing rules by creating a user with no access to a record, updating the record to meet the sharing rule criteria, and validating that access has been granted:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-apex">
@isTest
static void testSharingRulesWithCriteria() {
    // Step 1: Create a user with limited access
    Profile limitedProfile = [SELECT Id FROM Profile WHERE Name = 'Standard User' LIMIT 1];
    User limitedUser = new User(
        Username = 'limiteduser@test.com',
        Email = 'limiteduser@test.com',
        LastName = 'Limited',
        Alias = 'limited',
        TimeZoneSidKey = 'America/Los_Angeles',
        LocaleSidKey = 'en_US',
        EmailEncodingKey = 'UTF-8',
        ProfileId = limitedProfile.Id,
        LanguageLocaleKey = 'en_US'
    );
    insert limitedUser;

    // Step 2: Create a record that doesn't initially meet the sharing rule criteria
    Account privateAccount = new Account(Name = 'Private Account', Industry = 'Other');
    insert privateAccount;

    // Verify the user initially has no access
    System.runAs(limitedUser) {
        List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id = :privateAccount.Id];
        System.assertEquals(0, accounts.size(), 'User should not have access to the account initially.');
    }

    // Step 3: Update the record to meet the sharing rule criteria
    privateAccount.Industry = 'Technology'; // Assuming the sharing rule is based on Industry = 'Technology'
    update privateAccount;

    // Step 4: Verify the user now has access
    System.runAs(limitedUser) {
        List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id = :privateAccount.Id];
        System.assertEquals(1, accounts.size(), 'User should have access to the account after sharing rule is applied.');
    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Unit Testing Assignment Rules</h2>
        <p>Assignment Rules automatically assign records to users or queues based on predefined criteria. Testing assignment rules involves inserting a record and validating its owner after the rule is triggered.</p>

        <h3>Example Test for Assignment Rules</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-apex">
@isTest
static void testAssignmentRules() {
    // Create a Lead to trigger assignment rules
    Lead testLead = new Lead(LastName = 'Test', Company = 'Test Company');
    Database.DMLOptions dmlOpts = new Database.DMLOptions();
    dmlOpts.assignmentRuleHeader.useDefaultRule = true;
    testLead.setOptions(dmlOpts);
    insert testLead;

    // Query the lead and validate assignment
    Lead assignedLead = [SELECT OwnerId FROM Lead WHERE Id = :testLead.Id];
    System.assertNotEquals(UserInfo.getUserId(), assignedLead.OwnerId, 'Lead should be assigned to a different owner based on the assignment rule.');
}
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Unit Testing Field-Level Security</h2>
        <p>Field-Level Security (FLS) ensures that sensitive fields are accessible only to authorized users. Unit tests should verify that the system enforces FLS rules correctly.</p>

        <h3>Example Test for Field-Level Security</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-apex">
@isTest
static void testFieldLevelSecurity() {
    // Check if a sensitive field is accessible
    Boolean isFieldAccessible = Schema.sObjectType.Account.fields.SomeSensitiveField__c.isAccessible();

    // Assert that the field is accessible (positive case)
    System.assert(isFieldAccessible, 'FLS check is working correctly. Sensitive field is accessible.');

    // Assert that the field is not accessible (negative case)
    // Use runAs if needed to simulate a user with restricted permissions
    System.runAs(new User(Id = UserInfo.getUserId())) {
        Boolean isFieldNotAccessible = !Schema.sObjectType.Account.fields.SomeSensitiveField__c.isAccessible();
        System.assert(isFieldNotAccessible, 'FLS check is working correctly. Sensitive field is not accessible.');
    }
}
        </code></pre>
